# Hi, I'm JM 👋

**Strategy is intent; code is reality.** I code agentically to ensure they actually align—building tools that solve real problems in my life, and learning from what breaks.

### 🧪 What I'm Building

**[Nutty Baseball](https://github.com/jmbeh/nutty_baseball)** — Learning baseball alongside my son. Peanuts theme reframed "I don't know baseball" from embarrassing to endearing.

**[Dad Aura](https://github.com/jmbeh/dad-aura)** — Real-time aura scoring from my son's Apple Watch. Lesson learned: him controlling score "flips" created more value than the scoring itself.

**[Allegro](https://github.com/jmbeh/Allegro)** — Music practice companion. Learned that audio recognition trained on studio recordings fails when kids stop mid-phrase and play wrong notes.

**[LifeSynced](https://github.com/jmbeh/LifeSynced)** — Unified calendar. Privacy-first design ([Personal Event] + password reveal) made it safe to demo with any audience.
